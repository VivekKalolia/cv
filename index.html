                    <p><em>Independent Artist, Musician & <strong>Classically Trained Vocalist</strong></em>.</p>
                    <p>I am a Professional Vocalist and a Passionate Musician. I got into Music when I was the age of 8. We had gone to a fare where people were given a chance to choose gifts if they won the number game (Bingo). My sister and my mom won the number and we had a chance to select any gift we would like. I and my mom went to select a gift and I saw a small Casio keyboard, that looked very fascinating to me. I told my mom to get that for us, and that is how I got my first ever Casio keyboard! Since then, I used to listen and play to songs and as years went by, I also slowly started getting into singing. I currently am a student of Hindustani Classical Music. I do live shows for restaurants, weddings as well as concerts and I also teach Music classes to students.</p></td>
